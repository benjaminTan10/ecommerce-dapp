This is my second implementation of a decentralized E-commerce marketplace built on top of EVM-compatible Blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon. The previous dapp only allowed users to buy and sell single items without quantity. However, this new version is much more advanced and includes a wide range of features. Users can now create their own stores with customized branding and sell products with limited or unlimited quantities. Additionally, buyers have the ability to review the products they purchase. I have also introduced an Auction market, inspired by popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, however my implementation is more generalized and accepts a variety of products. It's important to note that all payments within the marketplace remain with cryptocurrency tokens.

## Getting Started


## How it Works

### Main Market

This is the core of the old version [marketplace V1](https://github.com/Aymen1001/MarketPlace-dapp) and it's made for single items purchase , User can add a product by providing the product name, description, price in $ and image.

![Capture d’écran 2022-03-03 à 22 36 53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/156660595-9432f950-941d-465f-ad69-bb0edaad32b7.png)

The platform ensures a good interaction between the seller and the buyer by deviding the purchase process (product state) into 4 steps:
  <ul>
    <li><b>In Sale:</b> The first step when a seller list it's product on the market </li>
    <li><b>Pending:</b> When a product is bought the amount paid is locked in the smart contract and buyer waits for seller to sent the product </li>
    <li><b>Sent:</b> The seller sends the product and waits for the buyer confirmation</li>
    <li><b>Sold:</b> The buyer confirms the recieval and the funds are transfered to the seller </li> 
  </ul>
 
All this steps can be performed on the product page: 


<table>
  <tr>
     <td style="text-align:center;">Seller Point of view </td>
     <td style="text-align:center;">Buyer Point of view </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/156660145-aacb1ff4-2ba3-44d5-8bb9-87c927571b6b.png"></td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/156660202-5bbb40db-ccf6-4a9f-88eb-3b407eca0211.png"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>


### The Store

The dapp enables sellers to create their own order based stores, They can add limited and unlimited quantity products. 

Store Page:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/161355217-4bebbe79-9a28-454d-8249-6db70213ce22.png">

<br/>

Seller Dashboard:

Each seller willing to create a new store must provide a name and the store logo:

</p>

On the product page you can find all details regarding the product(seller, quantity, price,...) and the reviews posted by previous buyers,
When an order is created it goes through 3 main states: 
<ul>
  <li><b>PENDING:</b> just created and waiting for seller acceptance</li>
  <li><b>SENT:</b> product sent and waiting for buyer recieval confirmation</li>
  <li><b>COMPLETED:</b> The order is complete so seller recieve payment and buyer can leave a review </li>    
</ul>

### Auction Market

User can start an auction for any type of products by providing name, description, starting price, auction duration (in hours), item image.
Bidders can offer an initial bid and outbid if necessary without having to withdraw their fund on each bid, the highest bidder will be determined after the end of the auction clock

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How to Use

    
### Scripts

   In the MarketPlace-Dapp-V2 folder you'll find a directory scripts, it contain all the python code for deploying your contracts and also some useful functions

   The reset.py file is used to remove all previous contracts deployments from build directory:
   ```sh
   brownie run scripts/reset.py
   ```
   The deploy.py file allow the deployment to the testnet/local-network:
   ```sh
   brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network=ganache-local
   ```
   The update_front_end.py is used to transfer all the smart contracts data (abi,...) and addresses to the front end in the artifacts directory:
   ```sh
   brownie run scripts/update_front_end.py
   ```
   
   After running this 3 cammands, the MarketPlace contract is now deployed and is integrated with the front end
